a few notes:

# ssh

it's good to get ssh set up in general, but my GitHub account is set with 2FA so it's kinda indispensible:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

GitHub recovery keys are (now) int the key vault

# aws 

ensure you get the aws keys and install the cli. Update .aws/credentials

# iTerm

macos has changed the default shell to `zsh`. Rather than changing the default macos system shell to bash, I installed gnu bash (from homebrew) and set it as the default shell in iTerm. In case ... anything from apple expects a zshell.

The venerable zenburn color theme serves me well, but the red and blue ANSI colors are too dim to be useful. So I just manually cranked those up in the iTerm profile settings.
